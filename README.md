#Project Records Log

** Thu 20 - Entry 1 **

- DESIGN: After the feedback from the Wednesday session, we went from alpha stage to beta stage with our design and UX experience.
  We moved the multiplayer feature into "if we get time basket", and focused in on a simpler design. Victor drew a fab logo
  and researching for other background pictures led us to our final logo design concept. The colours and images of which 
  we are going to bleed into the rest of the app.
  We are yet to finalise this design.  
- APIS: We explored the Trivia API and the GIF API, and experimented with displaying a gif in the dom. 
- GIT HUB: Yasmin went over how git hub projects work and transfered the to do list from the google doc into this programme. 
- APP FEATURES & PSEUDO CODE: By going through the user journey again we picked out the features that we will need for our app.
  We started the pseudo code for Screen 1&2. 
- HOT AIR: We managed to move on from disney fase into the critic phase. 
- SANDBAGS: Got bogged down in the weeds of the details and decisions were slow to come compared to previous sessions. We are going
  to use the timer to hopefully push things along and bring focus. 
  
  ** Fri 21 - Entry 2 **

- PSEUDO CODE: We finished off the pseudo-code for Screens 1-5. Git pushed and co-authored. We tried to start by one person leading the pseudo code and then poeople   jumping on the contribution. This took us the most time, as when we reached a parituclar feature, we were still questioning the design. We were agile with the       design and allowed ourselves to be felxible and realistic with our knowledged of code and ability to complete certain features by removing them. We removed the     timer, we removed score intended to be displayed during the game. 
- HARDCODING HTML: We laid the foundations of the HTML up to screen 4. 
- HARDCODING CSS: We did 2 lines for CSS colour selection 
- PLANNING: We discussed how we were going to tackle tomorrow's pair coding challenges and what screens or features were needed first before continuing, where the     crossover in code would happen so we could avoid repetion, and also what a democratic way of coding was so people could get expereince of handling APIS and         buttons and links.
