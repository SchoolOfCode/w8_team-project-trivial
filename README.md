#Project Records Log

** Thu 20 - Entry 1 **

- DESIGN: After the feedback from the Wednesday session, we went from alpha stage to beta stage with our design and UX experience.
  We moved the multiplayer feature into "if we get time basket", and focused in on a simpler design. Victor drew a fab logo
  and researching for other background pictures led us to our final logo design concept. The colours and images of which 
  we are going to bleed into the rest of the app.
  We are yet to finalise this design.  
- APIS: We explored the Trivia API and the GIF API, and experimented with displaying a gif in the dom. 
- GIT HUB: Yasmin went over how git hub projects work and transfered the to do list from the google doc into this programme. 
- APP FEATURES & PSEUDO CODE: By going through the user journey again we picked out the features that we will need for our app.
  We started the pseudo code for Screen 1&2. 
- HOT AIR: We managed to move on from disney fase into the critic phase. 
- SANDBAGS: Got bogged down in the weeds of the details and decisions were slow to come compared to previous sessions. We are going
  to use the timer to hopefully push things along and bring focus.
