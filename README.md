#Project Records Log

**Thu 20 - Entry 1 ** 6:30 - 10:30

- DESIGN: After the feedback from the Wednesday session, we went from alpha stage to beta stage with our design and UX experience.
  We moved the multiplayer feature into "if we get time basket", and focused in on a simpler design. Victor drew a fab logo
  and researching for other background pictures led us to our final logo design concept. The colours and images of which 
  we are going to bleed into the rest of the app.
  We are yet to finalise this design.  
  
- APIS: We explored the Trivia API and the GIF API, and experimented with displaying a gif in the dom. 

- GIT HUB: Yasmin went over how git hub projects work and transfered the to do list from the google doc into this programme. 

- APP FEATURES & PSEUDO CODE: By going through the user journey again we picked out the features that we will need for our app.
  We started the pseudo code for Screen 1&2. 
  
- HOT AIR: We managed to move on from disney fase into the critic phase. 

- SANDBAGS: Got bogged down in the weeds of the details and decisions were slow to come compared to previous sessions. We are going
  to use the timer to hopefully push things along and bring focus. 
  
  **Fri 21 - Entry 2 ** 6:30 - 10:30

- PSEUDO CODE/CODE PLAN: We finished off the pseudo-code for Screens 1-5. Git pushed and co-authored. We tried to start by one person leading the pseudo code and then poeople   jumping on the contribution. This took us the most time, as when we reached a parituclar feature, we were still questioning the design. We were agile with the       design and allowed ourselves to be felxible and realistic with our knowledged of code and ability to complete certain features by removing them. We removed the     timer, we removed score intended to be displayed during the game. 

- HARDCODING HTML: We laid the foundations of the HTML up to screen 4. 

- HARDCODING CSS: We did 2 lines for CSS colour selection 

- PLANNING: We discussed how we were going to tackle tomorrow's pair coding challenges and what screens or features were needed first before continuing, where the     crossover in code would happen so we could avoid repetion, and also what a democratic way of coding was so people could get expereince of handling APIS and         buttons and links. 
- HOT AIR: We are all focused on the task ahead and contious of timings. We are contieous of each other and what expereince we need to grow. 
- SANDBAGS: We couldn't seperate the planning from the psuedo coding. We struggled with the details and that skewed our timings. 

**Sat 22 - Entry 3 ** 10:00 - 5:30
- PAIR CODING: 
- Cat and Muna took Screen 4 which was handling the question API. Began by pseudo coding feature 3, which handled the question api, fetching it, then displaying each question from the returned array incramentally. 
- Vic and Yas took Screen 2 & 3 coding features 1-3 on both screens. (TBC)

- SANDBAGS: Muna and Cat got caught with call backs and passing in. Tao helped us pass the two question functions through the onlick button. Then Muna and Cat got caught in a for loop. The array would display the 10th question on click. Realised that the loop was looping through all the questions before it had had. chance to dsiplay and in fact the for loop was unecessary as we had already iterated the array and just needed to count through it incramentally. 

- HOT AIR: (TBC)

**Sun 23 - Entry 4 ** 10:30 - 5:30
- PAIR CODING: Muna and Cat were back on Screen 4 and this time they were sorting out extracting the answers from the array and displaying them. Got the correct answer out no problem but we had difficulty extracting the incorrect answers as they were in another array within the question array. We also realised that the button's we were trying to access within the dom were actually a nodelist and therefore reacting differently to an array. Managed to complete answer button feature. To save time, Cat took on the JS for the progress bar and Muna took on solving how to capture the user's score to the next screen. For the progress score bar realised that it could follow a similar logic to the array question and decided to place this within that function to streamline the code. 

- SANDBAGS: User score... drew on additional coding time and brains.

- HOT AIR: Pair coding and dividing tasks helped move the progress along. Finished the day with the majority of the JS complete ready to start CSS on Mon.

**Mon 24 - Entry 5 ** 6 - 12

- CSS: Began group coding screen 1 and Screen 2. Until Yas joined after work and then Yas and Muna split into pair coding to solve user score puzzle (TBC). Vic and Cat continued screen 2.
- SANDBAGS: Remebering flex with CSS. 
- HOT AIR: solidarity. Interest and passion for the project. Enjoiying the learning.
